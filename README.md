# blockchain-provider-test
Compares the response time between two blockchain providers via their websocket, in this case AWS and Alchemy. 

Made this repo to send to Alchemy to figure out how we can make it faster. 

Ran the test in `node-tests.json` on a AWS EC2 T2 medium in US East on Ubuntu 18 with Node 14. 

Obviously will need to have `web3` installed, with corresponding provider modules.
